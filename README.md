# cost-sensitive-method-of-class-imbalance-and-feature-interactions
The dataset used here is from Kaggle's playground for loan default. Here we have an imbalanced dataset and trying to use undersampling vs oversampling vs cost sensitive method to figure out the best way to clssify.
Also, we have used yellowbricks library to see feature interactions and class separations.
